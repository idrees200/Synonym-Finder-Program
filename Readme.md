# Synonym Finder Program

This C++ program allows users to enter pairs of words and their synonyms. It then tokenizes a user-provided text and replaces matching words with their synonyms.

## Features

- **Input**: Users enter the number of word-synonym pairs and then provide each word and its synonym.
- **Tokenization**: Takes a user-provided text input and tokenizes it into separate words.
- **Synonym Replacement**: Checks if any word in the tokenized text matches a word from the input pairs. If so, it replaces the word with its synonym.
- **Output**: Displays the entered words and their synonyms. Also shows the tokenized text with replaced synonyms.

## Usage

1. **Input Words and Synonyms**:
   - Enter the number of word-synonym pairs.
   - For each pair, enter a word and its synonym.

2. **Text Input**:
   - Enter a text for which you want to replace words with synonyms.

3. **Output**:
   - Displays the entered words and their synonyms.
   - Shows the tokenized text with replaced synonyms.

## Example

Suppose you input:
- Number of pairs: 3
- Pairs: { "happy" -> "joyful", "sad" -> "unhappy", "hot" -> "warm" }
- Text: "I feel happy today but sad because it's hot."

To fix the code and create a corresponding README.md file, let's proceed step by step.

Fixing the Code
Here are the issues I found in your code and the corresponding fixes:

Memory Allocation for words and synonyms Arrays:

The size of words[i] and synonyms[i] arrays should be based on the lengths of the input strings (buffer and buffer2), not just their sizes (which are incorrectly set to the length + 1).
Corrected the allocation of words[i] and synonyms[i] arrays based on the actual string lengths.
Input Handling:

Adjusted input handling to correctly read strings including spaces using getline(cin, input) after reading rows.
Tokenized the input string into separate words and stored them in newarr.
Output and Processing:

Ensured proper comparison and output of synonyms based on the matched words from newarr with words array entries.
Fixed comparison logic inside the check function to correctly check for matching words.
Memory Deallocation:

Implemented a deallocation function to free the dynamically allocated memory for words and synonyms arrays after use.
Here is the corrected C++ code:
